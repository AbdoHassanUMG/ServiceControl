ServiceControl
=====================

ServiceControl is the monitoring brain in the Particular Service Platform.

The information is then exposed to [ServicePulse](https://particular.net/servicepulse) and [ServiceInsight](https://particular.net/serviceinsight) via an HTTP API and SignalR notifications.
